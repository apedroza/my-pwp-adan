`This site should answer most qustions about my current 
professional career`

## Milestone 1 Feedback
Based on what you've put together here, I can see that your plan for this project is for it to be a professional portfolio site to attract freelance clients for web marketing and development gigs; with your ideal client being the independent entrepreneurial type. 

Down the line (after class), inclusion of a blog might do well to increase your web presence and help with your SEO and web marketing efforts. Unfortunately this would be out-of-scope for now.

What you've put together here will provide you with a good guide as you begin your design phase in Milestone 2a. 

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin [Milestone 2a](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/).

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- It looks like the most current version of your code has not been pushed to GitHub. Remember to commit early and often. This is of critical importance, especially in capstone.
- Don't forget to always use the `alt` attribute on all `<img>` tags.
- Please note that the `<b>` tag is deprecated. Use `<strong>` instead.
- Where did the **_config.yml** file come from? This is a Jekyll file. Delete this - we're definitely not using Jekyll for PWP.

## Milestone 2a feedback
Good start on the wireframes. Continue to refine your layout plans and wireframes before you begin to build your PWP. I think a bit more clarity and detail will provide you with a better guide before you begin to code.

For example, if I were creating this PWP I would need more detail in the wireframe about the Resume format. A resume section is usually more complex than a simple block of paragraph text. Will there be headings, columns, iconography, etc? This would affect how you write your HTML and CSS.

I would also consider adding an email field to your contact form - and make it a required field. This way you have some contact information so you can return the email.

One area that I'm unsure about is the group of links in the first panel of the Desktop view. This region is not explained in your Content Strategy so I don't really know what it is, but I'm assuming it's a Tag Cloud. A Tag Cloud is a group of links  that are usually sorted visually by size, that link back to a list of posts that have specific tags. This specific kind of functionality would require a back end, and is out of scope for PWP. (This is something that WordPress does out-of-the-box however.) BUT - if you were just thinking of having this be a group of REGULAR LINKS, take a look at this jQuery plugin: [jQ Cloud](http://mistic100.github.io/jQCloud/)

Directory structure and code looks good. Nice use of JavaScript!

Your Milestone 2&alpha;passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin work on your PWP, but I do recommend additional work on your layout choices prior to coding. We will cover Bootstrap on Monday - which we will be using to build our layouts. Meanwhile, you can use the time to continue to refine your layout and gather/create content.
