`This site should answer most qustions about my current 
professional career`

## Milestone 1 Feedback
Based on what you've put together here, I can see that your plan for this project is for it to be a professional portfolio site to attract freelance clients for web marketing and development gigs; with your ideal client being the independent entrepreneurial type. 

Down the line (after class), inclusion of a blog might do well to increase your web presence and help with your SEO and web marketing efforts. Unfortunately this would be out-of-scope for now.

What you've put together here will provide you with a good guide as you begin your design phase in Milestone 2a. 

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin [Milestone 2a](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/).

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- It looks like the most current version of your code has not been pushed to GitHub. Remember to commit early and often. This is of critical importance, especially in capstone.
- Don't forget to always use the `alt` attribute on all `<img>` tags.
- Please note that the `<b>` tag is deprecated. Use `<strong>` instead.
- Where did the **_config.yml** file come from? This is a Jekyll file. Delete this - we're definitely not using Jekyll for PWP.
